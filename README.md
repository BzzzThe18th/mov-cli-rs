## Installation
Installing mov-cli-rs is as easy as ensuring cargo and rust are both installed and running `cargo install mov-cli-rs` in your terminal. Before running this, ensure you have all the dependencies listed below.

### Dependencies
- **Supported OS:**
  - Linux (**not tested**)
  - Windows
- **[![rust][rust-shield]](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)** (**required**)
- **[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)** (**required**)
- **[![mpv][mpv-shield]](https://mpv.io/installation/)** (recommended - **only** extraction will work without mpv)

## Usage
The basic CLI command is just `mov-cli-rs`, the only required argument is the search term. The most basic usage of this can look like `mov-cli-rs "bee and puppycat"`.
### Extraction Argument
The `--extract` argument prints the playlist URL to your terminal instead of opening the player with the URL.
### Quality Argument
The `-q` or `--quality` argument allows you to specify a quality that will be selected if found, if not, it will default to the highest quality. Values for this argument look like `720p` or `auto`, so `-q 360p` would use the 360p URL if available.
### First Argument
The `-f` or `--first` argument selects the first result instead of displaying the series menu.
### Season Argument
The `-s` or `--season` argument selects the specified season instead of diplsaying the season menu.
### Episode Argument
The `-e` or `--episode` argument selects the specified episode instead of displaying the episode menu.
### Examples
If you wanted to, for example, play season 21 episode 3 of south park at 720p and you know it'll be the first result, you could use
```
mov-cli-rs "south park" -f -s 21 -e 3 -q 720p
```
